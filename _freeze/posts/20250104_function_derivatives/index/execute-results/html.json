For every distribution, 1000 samples were drawn at each of the following sizes: n = 3, 5, 10, and 20. For each sample, the mean was computed, and the resulting sampling distributions were visualized (@fig-sampling).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .preview-image}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of simulated populations (top row): normal, right-skewed, and uniform. Each subsequent row shows the sampling distribution of the sample mean based on 1,000 samples drawn from the corresponding population.
